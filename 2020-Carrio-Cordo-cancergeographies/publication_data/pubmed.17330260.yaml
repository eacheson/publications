notes: All 35 tumors were analyzed with 16k cDNA arrays. In 8 tumors with 14q changes,
  hybridizations were redone with 44k Agilent oligo-arrays. For some of the cases,
  CGH data was available from another study (PMID 10919666); those cases were only
  reported here, to avoid duplication of results in the database.
