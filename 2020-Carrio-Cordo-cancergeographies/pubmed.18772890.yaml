notes: The original data was submitted to the TCGA Data Coordinating Center. Data
  represented in Progenetix is from 223 cases identified in the TCGA FTP archive (ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov:21/tcga/tumor/gbm/cgcc),
  analyzed at the MSKCC using Agilent 244k genomic arrays (accessed 2008-09-16). Aberrant
  genomic intervals were derived from the regions files, with fusion of duplicate
  experiments as guessed from the sample IDs. Some filtering for apparently systematic
  errors (14q11, 15q11 ...) was performed.
